    <h1>Pairing is Caring</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Pairing is invigorating, and keeps me focused through a challenge. It ensures many fewer visits to facebook, and significantly reduced meme chasing. I have learned something from every one of my pairing partners - even if it didn’t feel like a natural personality fit when undertaking the challenge.</p>

<p>HOWEVER - I also know that am an introvert. Even though I love to socialize and collaborate, I also need personal time to recharge my social batteries. I love working by myself on artistic projects, and have ‘my’ workflow well established as a musician.  I understand my social needs pretty well too. I love to dance to the wee hours… but I’ll probably spend the next day in my PJs nursing a cup of tea. </p>

<p>I am excited by the emphasis on pairing at DBC and in the tech world more generally. It’s one of the aspects of web development that seems most appealing to me as I transition from a pro musician- it feels very familiar. And I’m much more interested in people than computers! </p>

<p>At the same time - the prospect of 9 weeks of super-saturated socializing makes me a wee bit terrified. I have no doubt I can stay focused and work the hours. I love intense projects. I’m a little more worried whether I’ll be able to feel balanced when I’m surrounded by so many people during the majority of my waking hours!</p>

<p>As for feedback - 
I really appreciate honesty. 
I have been criticized for being unreservedly honest (this was a while back, and I’ve actively worked to temper my honesty with kindness and care), and I appreciate when people mirror back to me the same kind of honesty that I try to project. </p>

<p>SO - it’s very exciting to read back over my feedback, and feel that my contributions and honesty are well received. </p>

<p>My biggest challenges will be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Staying flexible within pairing sessions, and truly stepping back when my partner is navigating.</li>
  <li>Encouraging playfulness within the work.</li>
  <li>Creating a positive working environment EVEN IF I don’t necessarily jive 100% with partner’s styles. </li>
</ol>

<p>The hardest feedback I’ve had to write have been for 2 difficult sessions - and I was torn within the sessions for how to behave. In both of the sessions, I had a decently clear idea of how to solve the problems. And I felt my partners didn’t understand the problem, and were navigating us down the wrong path. Also, the partners may not have held clearly to the defined roles, or the release instructions… so it was hard to keep us on track!</p>

<p>I tend to try to be ‘polite’ which mean I do not coopt the session and strong arm my sense of where to go. I try to explain my thought process and build consensus with my partner.
But if my partner doesn’t read or understand the instructions, and doesn’t let me navigate when it’s my turn - what to do? </p>

<p>And - honestly, I don’t know what the right answer is. </p>

<p>BUT - 
OVERALL - My experience with pairing has been overwhelmingly positive. It’s a real privilege to be learning with so many driven, curious, and friendly people. Looking forward to much more!</p>
