			<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>


			<p>I have felt stereotype threat many times in my life, but I'd like to explore an opportunity where I not only FELT it, but actually fulfilled one stereotype I was in fear of emulating. And I will hide my blushing cheeks behind a computer screen. Luckily, about 10 years later, I do think I've learned and grown just a bit. But this is a good reminder.</p>

			<img id="odd_chair" src="../images/oddmanout.jpg">

			<p><br>When I was in college, I was encouraged by my advisor to take a class exploring the theory and organizing strategies of people of color. I'm really glad he did, because my horizon was broadened immensely by the experience. I was introduced for the first time to Audre Lord's writing, and queer theory more generally. The class opened my eyes to many of the inequalities I hadn't even understood were shaping my reality. It was a class that literally changed my life, encouraging my personal growth and giving me the language to be an engaged member of society.</p>

			<p><br>The class itself was a small workshop. Of 18 students, the only males were myself, a white Jewish man, and a second white Jewish man. As I remember it (and my memory may be faulty here), every other student was a woman of color. The professor was a young woman of color herself. </p>

			<p><br>The class explored race and gender politics in America. And a priority of the class was documenting personal experience, and shifting the default academic voice from the striving to be objective to the embracing personal experience as a resource to weigh on par with text.</p>

			<p><br>So, basically, we read about race, gender, class, and sexuality in America. Then we sat in a circle and talked about how we felt.</p>

			<p><br>I was terrified.
			Every single class.
			I didn't want to say something insensitive, but inevitably I did. Several times. Once when discussing the Los Angeles I had grown up in, I referenced the prevalence of "illegal aliens" in the city.
			The term I had taken for granted is intrinsically a dehumanizing term for people who I then learned should be referred to as undocumented workers. My misuse of language in that instance was  an important education. But I didn't want to admit my ignorance every class, and display all the assumptions I had assimilated as a white male.</p>

			<p><br>So I spent a lot of time in class listening and learning, while mostly staying silent.</p>

			<p><br>My super embarrassing mistake of male-entitlement came at the end of a second semester's class with the same teacher. I was so taken with the material and the professor that I signed up for another class that explored memoir.</p>

			<p><br>As my final paper, I submit a memoir about my developing sexuality (I was in the process of discovering that I am bi) and an intimate experience I had with a friend who was experiencing loss. It was a really honest piece, and it was important for me to write it.</p>

			<p><br>The piece was really well received by my professor, and she gave personal feedback. She wrote something along the lines of "your piece gave a great insight into your experience with love and life, and I look forward to learning more".</p>

			<p><br>I, being in a situation where a woman in power was giving me positive feedback on a piece I had written about my sexuality, misinterpreted this as a coded proposition from my professor.</p>

			<p><br>I inquired, via email, if this is what was happening. Of course it wasn't. And I was mortified.</p>

			<p><br>But I think part of my mistaken assumption had to do with entitlement and subtle misogyny. I was studying women's agency, queer theory, and radical organizing. But, when a woman in power gave me positive feedback I immediately assumed there was a sexual undercurrent. All the content I had studied was forgotten- and my reasoning was reduced to "woman praise = sexual attention". Fail.</p>

			<p><br>Ok- nice story. What's the take away, and how does this inform my future choices?</p>

			<p><br>As for reducing stereotype threat that others' may be feeling from me, I can be very specific about welcoming and appreciating contributions each person is making personally. Target what a team member is doing well, and publically appreciate that contribution. Give feedback and criticism in a way that encourages growth rather than shutting it down. "I noticed this in your work, and I think you can improve what you are already doing well be doing x,y, z..."</p>

			<p><br>As for countering my own experience of stereotype threat - this is still a challenge for me. I often have a very active self editor, and double or triple verify that I say what I really want to say. Which at teams can lead to stuttering or slowed speech. </p>
