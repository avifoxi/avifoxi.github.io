			<p class="first">I like pretty things. Can't deny it. And I've been quite excited to make pretty things on the interweb. As I've been prepping to enter DBC, I have been spending perhaps <em>too much</em> time exploring tools to enhance front end presentation. And I feel like I still have a long way to go... But nothing fortifies me like a nice bourbon...</p>
 
			<p>This page will serve as a How-To reference (aka cheat sheet), for how to set up a pretty web page from scratch, using Sass and a set of tools the independent development firm <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/">Thoughtbot</a> has generously made available to schmos like us.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Starting from scratch, open terminal, make a 'sassy-bartender' file: <span class="code">mkdir sassy-bartender</span></li>
				<li>In terminal: <span class="code">cd sassy-bartender</span> Create the index page: <span class="code">touch index.html</span></li>
				<li>Create a styles folder: <span class="code">mkdir styles</span></li>
				<li>cd into styles, and create two files: <span class="code">touch bartend.css bartend.scss</span></li>

			      <p class="body">Which brings me to <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>. Sass is an industry standard, a CSS pre-processor. Sass brings much of the functionality that we've all grown to love in more functional programming languages into CSS. Functionality like variables, mix-ins, inheritance. <br>What's not to like!</p>

			      <p class="body">You utilize Sass by working in one of two types of files (.scss, or .sass), writing Sass's shorthand. The gem then translates the shorthand into complete CSS. In my limited time working with Sass, I've found I prefer working .scss files over .sass, as they're a bit closer syntactically to the .css we all love to um... love.  <br>I'll walk you through the installation process on OS X to get it running on our sassy project. If you're running a different OS, visit the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">site</a>, docs are excellent:</p>

			<h3 class="center">Install and Link</h3>

			<ol>
				<li>Open up terminal. And type <span class="code">gem install sass</span>Now feel the sass. Growl.</li>
				<li>cd into our sassy-bartender/styles, and set the Sass gem to work on our style sheets: <span class="code">sass --watch bartend.css:bartend.scss</span></li>
			</ol>

			      <h1>Set a Watch</h1>
			       <p class="body">We just linked our two style sheets. Sass will be watching any changes we make to bartender.scss <br>The .scss format enables the mixins and shortcuts we like SO MUCH, the Sass gem translates this shorthand (which doesn't yet exist in CSS itself) to our bartender.css file. EASY PEASY.</p>

			<h3 class="center">I'll Take a Manhattan, Bartender</h3>
			<h4 class="center">Installing cool gems and putting the files in the right places.</h4>

			<p>Now we start mixing drinks. We're going to download a set of design gems, that let us design basic web pages more elegantly, and (hopefully) easily. Let's download the 3 gems:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Enter Terminal, and install these three gems. For gem installation, the directory where you run these commands is irrelevant: <span class="code"><br>gem install bourbon
				<br>gem install neat
				<br>gem install bitters</span></li>

				<li>If you're not there already, cd into the project styles folder. Now install the files into your styles folder. This is not gem installation, rather this imports Thoughtbot's liquor themed templates, mixins and tools  into our sassy-bartender: <span class="code"><br>bourbon install <br>neat install <br>bitters install</span></li>

				<li>In your text editor, the HEAD of your index.html file, add these 2 style links in this order: <span class="code">  &#60;link rel="stylesheet" src="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/3.0.1/normalize.css"&#62; <br>&#60;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/bartend.css"&#62;</span></li>
	
			</ol>

			<div class="modal">
			  <label for="modal-3">
			    <div class="btn js-btn">Have I Made a Terrible Mistake???</div>
			  </label>
			  <input class="modal-state" id="modal-3" type="checkbox" />
			  <div class="modal-window">
			    <div class="modal-inner">
			      <label class="modal-close" for="modal-3"></label>
			      <h1>Woooozy...</h1>
			       <p class="body">We might have had one too many there, hey? We have so many files to explore for our design! TOO MANY!! If this is your first time, your head may be spinning, you may even feel a bit sick.... <br>But Worry Not! You'll soon learn to enjoy a fine cocktail. We'll need to callibrate everything to make the tools behave well together. Otherwise they will make you miserable.</p>
			       <p class="body">normalize.css exists to wipe the design slate clean across any browser platform. We want to link here first in our header, before links to our active design with the Bourbon based tools.</p>
			    </div>
			  </div>
			</div>

			
			<h3 class="center">Walk in a straight line sir...</h3>
			<h4 class="center">Import Thoughtbot's tools in the correct order so they behave.</h4>

			<ol>
				<li>Inside bartend.scss in your text editor, we'll make our first imports that will let us do awesome stuff faster: 
					<span class="code">@charset "utf-8";
					<br>@import 'bourbon/bourbon';
					<br>@import 'base/grid-settings';
					<br>@import 'neat/neat';
					<br>@import 'base/base';</span>
				</li>
				<li>Inside the styles directory, open the 'base' or 'bitters' folder (depending on how your system downloads and assigns the name), and open the file <br>_grid-settings.scss  <br>In line 1, make the change noted if you are designing a static site rather than a rails app.</li>
				<li>And save...</li>
			</ol>

			<p>That's all for now. I realize I've opened a Pandora's box here - there is a LOT to digest. Trust me, I'm right there with you. BUT - this is an amazing bundle of tools that can potentially make our design jobs MUCH quicker and more efficient.</p>

			<p>I'll be back very soon with some tips from the trenches for you, and some more example of layouts done with these tools. I'll explain what the different tools do, and how they interact.</p> 

			<p>In the meantime, if you're thirsty, visit the Docs for these tool, <a href="http://bourbon.io/docs/">HERE</a>, <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/docs/">HERE</a> and <a href="http://bitters.bourbon.io/">HERE</a>. And yes, btw, this page was designed using all the tools mentioned above. So visit your local dive and mix up a few drinks!</p>
