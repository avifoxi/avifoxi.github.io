  <h2>A few lines about 'Free Time'</h2>

  <p>The times I've been happiest and most driven are when I have the ability to structure my own free time to do projects and have experiences that i think are meaningful. I love to work and work hard, particularly on creative problems. But I like to have the freedom to structure my time, and take breaks as I take on these projects. Obviously, I'm making a certain sacrifice in this regard going to DBC. But long term, I think an expanded skillset in tech will allow me more flexiblity and security to be creative and make cool stuff. </p>

<h2>The last topic someone asked my advice on:</h2>
<p>My brother is a musician too. He and I have had many conversations recently asking each others' advice. We've both made some pretty significant life changes based on the reality that neither of us is making a comfortable living, to start a family and live comfortably. My brother moved to Vienna, to take advantage of the social benefits, and continue as an artist an ethnographer. I'm learning how to code. Advice? More like taking stock and helping each other answer questions honestly for ourselves. </p>
