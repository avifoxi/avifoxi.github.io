			<h1>(Un)real world applications for classes.</h1>
			 

			<p><br>The world can be a very scary place. And with the aid of Ruby Classes, we can model the interactions of real (or not so real) objects. 

			When we create a Class in Ruby, we are creating a template for a new Ruby object. <br>Say, for example, a <span class="scary">SCARY MONSTER!!!</span></p>

			
			<p><br>So - in keeping with the DBC ethic of embracing our fears in hopes of overcoming them, <span class="scary">Welcome to the Class of SCARY MONSTERS!!</span> 

			<br>First we will define our class, and define what an initialized object of the <span class="scary">Scary Monster</span> class will contain.</p> 

			<p class="code">
			<br>class <span class="scary">Scary_monster</span>
				<br><span class="indent">def initialize(name, scariest_feature, speed, strength, alive=true)</span>
					<span class="indentier">@name = name</span>
					<span class="indentier">@scariest_feature = scariest_feature</span>
					<span class="indentier">@speed = speed</span>
					<span class="indentier">@strength = strength</span>
					<span class="indentier">@alive = alive</span>
				<span class="indent">end</span>
			</p>

			<p>Notice that we'll initialize an object with 5 parameters, which will make for some <span class="scary">SCARY</span> interactions. When we instantiate a new <span class="scary">Scary Monster</span>, we provide 4 parameters (the 5th is default assigned). And these parameters become the INSTANCE VARIABLES common to EVERY object of this class. 
			We designate instance variables with @ before the variable text. 

			<br>Every <span class="scary">Scary Monster</span> will have a:
			<ul>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Scariest Feature</li>
				<li>Speed rating (statistically calculated between 1 - 10)</li>
				<li>Strength rating (also scientifically calculated to a value between 1 and 10)</li>
				<li>And a default alive variable of true</li>
			</ul>


			<br>Sooo.... What do scary monsters do all day ?</p>

			<br>Well... firstly, they SCARE. 
			<br>So, we'd better provide a class method for our Scary Monsters do this, or they'll be very unfulfilled scary monsters. 


			<p class="code">
			<span class="indent">def scare</span>
				<span class="indentier">puts "BOO!! \n#{@name} comes outa nowhere and terrifies the bejeeezus outa you \nwith its #{@scariest_feature}!"</span>
			<span class="indent">end</span>
			</p>


			<p>Whoa! That is scary! 
			<br>Notice how we make use of the instance variables. When a <span class="scary">Scary_Monster</span> calls the scare function, it's individual instance methods are inserted to the curly braces, for a personalized fright. 
			Boo. 

			<br>What else do Scary Monsters do ?

			<br>THEY ATTACK !!

			<br>And that is very scary. 
			<br>very. 
			<br>scary.</p> 

			<p>Here's where things also get a little complicated. We need 2 different objects of the same class to interact within the same method. We will need to be careful with instance variables, and create some additional methods to be used within the attack method. But don't be SCARED! </p>

			<p><br>First off - how do we know which Scary Monster would win in a fight ?

			<br>We have to calculate the Whoop Quotient. 
			<br>Obviously.</p>

			<p class="code">
			<span class="indent">def whoop_quotient</span>
				<span class="indentier">@speed * @strength</span>
			<span class="indent">end</span>
			</p>

			<p>We will also need to access a Scary Monster's name within the Attack method. </p>

			<p class="code"><span class="indent">def name</span>
				<span class="indentier">@name</span>
			<span class="indent">end</span>
			</p>



			<p>And if things don't go as planned for one of the monsters, we'll need a kill function, to change the @alive variable to false. As an interesting aside that I discovered in writing this blog post - you cannot delete an object once instantiated in Ruby! So - I suppose this is good news if you're a Scary Monster thats been whooped. And once whooped, rather than deleting we will simply assign the @alive instance variable to false. </p>

			<p class="code">
			<span class="indent">def kill</span>
				<span class="indentier">@alive = false</span>
			<span class="indent">end </span>
			</p>

			<p class="center"><h2>Now we are ready for an ATTACK METHOD!!</h2>

			<p><span class="scary" "center">BWAAHAAHAAHAA!!!! </span>

			<br>Observe. </p></p>

			<p class="code">
			<span class="indent">def attack(scary_monster)</span>
				
				<span class="indentier">puts "#{@name} attacks #{scary_monster.name}!"</span>
				<span class="indentier">if self.whoop_quotient > scary_monster.whoop_quotient</span>
					<span class="indent"><span class="indentier">puts "#{@name} whoops #{scary_monster.name}'s behind."</span></span>
					<span class="indent"><span class="indentier">scary_monster.kill</span></span>
				<span class="indentier">else</span>
					<span class="indent"><span class="indentier">puts "OH NO! #{@name} is outclassed and makes a run for it!!! "</span></span>
				<span class="indentier">end</span>
			<span class="indent">end</span>
			</p>

			<p><br>WAIT!!!
			<br>HOLD YOUR HORSES DUDE!!</p>

			<p><br>This is scary. 
			<br>We are in the Scary Monster Class. 
			<br>We have a method 'attack' that an object of Scary_Monster can call, which accepts a parameter of scary_monster.</p>

			<p class="scary">WHAT ??</p>

			<p>ok - one object of Scary_Monster will call attack. In this method, the monster that calls the attack may reference its own instance variables. And when referring to itself in the method - we reference it as 'self'. </p>

			<p>What does the parameter scary_monster point to?  
			<br>It points to a <span class="scary">DIFFERENT SCARY MONSTER</span> that is the object of the attack. And to access this second object's instance variables, we have to use name and whoop quotient methods defined above. </p>

			<p>Finally- our complete Class definition is closed, so let's be sure to end it.</p>

			<p class="code">end</p>

			<p>Ok -</p>  

			<p>Now - all the pieces are ready to play! 
			<br>Let's make some Scary Monsters and MAKE 'EM FIGHT!! </p>

			<p class="code">
			
			<br>boogeyman = Scary_monster.new('The Boogeyman', 'Shadow Lurk of Terror', 5, 3)
			<br>frankenstein = Scary_monster.new('Frankenstein', 'Cadaver Breath', 2, 8)

			<br>frankenstein.scare
			<br>puts ' '
			<br>boogeyman.scare

			<br>puts ' '

			<br>boogeyman.attack(frankenstein)
			<br>frankenstein.attack(boogeyman)

			</p>



			Now sit back and read about it in the Terminal's Printout. 
			<span class="scary">It was a scary day in scary monster land. </span>

			<p class="code">
			<br>BOO!! 
			<br>Frankenstein comes outa nowhere and terrifies the bejeeezus outa you 
			with its Cadaver Breath!
			 
			<p class="code"><br>BOO!! </p>
			<p class="code"><br>The Boogeyman comes outa nowhere and terrifies the bejeeezus outa you 
			with its Shadow Lurk of Terror!</p>
			 
			<p class="code">The Boogeyman attacks Frankenstein!</p>
			<p class="code">OH NO! The Boogeyman is outclassed and makes a run for it!!!
			<br>Frankenstein attacks The Boogeyman!
			<br>Frankenstein whoops The Boogeyman's behind. </p>
