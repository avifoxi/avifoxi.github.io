<!-- I don't have much of an idea for how to make a blog template - but a few weeks ago I built one within GA's Dash tutorial. 
For the most part, I'm copying both HTML structure + CSS from that tutorial. Will hopefully revise and improve in the coming weeks - but as it's Sunday - I'm gonna knock this thing out as quick as I can.

	<p>It's sunday afternoon of phase 0, week 1, and here I am scrambling to do everything I need to do, because there's so much to do!</p>

	
	<p>For this first technical blog post, I'll be reviewing three web sites from a design perspective. <br>Given that I come from an independent music background, I'll be reviewing three sites that are much discussed by musicians. <a href="http://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a>. While these may not be my favorite sites, these are the three sites I may visit most often lately to discover and consume music. Let's check out their design. </p>

<h2><a href="http://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a></h2>

	<p>Bandcamp is a music delivery site tailored to independent musicians.</p>

	<h3>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</h3>

		<p>From an artist's perspective, there is very little red tape to go through to get your music up, into a solid framework for selling and streaming. Not only am I a big fan of the site, but I use the site to host all my albums, and I've made a lot of albums. Ho boy. I'm not alone there; many friends and musicians I admire are big fans of the site and what it does for them. All you need to sell is a paypal account, and you can upload as much music as you like for free. The service takes a cut of sales. Artists set the price of their content - from free on upward.</p>

		<p>From a user's perspective, this is a portal to a ton of music. All independent, and all streaming for free. The majority of releases are 'pay what you will', so consumers can decide what they think a piece is worth to them and deliver their 'fair' price to the artist. There is a ton of material, not all of it pro-quality... but much of it is really excellent. Bandcamp also creates a weekly podcast with new releases to discover recordings you might not otherwise encounter.</p>


	<h3>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</h3>

		<p>To be honest, I'm not impressed by the design of <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp's homepage</a>. It feels cluttered - even though I know they are offering a ton of information, I would like to see a less busy entryway.</p>

		<p>Where I am much more impressed is in the layout of Bandcamp's album pages. Let's visit the page of one of my favorite musicians and humans, <a href="http://cornmo.bandcamp.com/">Corn Mo</a>.</p>

		<p>This first link takes us to his home page. Looks good! Clean header, and releases are listed in chonological order, from newest down to oldest. You can choose from the sidebar to follow him, expand his bio info, visit his website, and get in touch.</p>

		<p>Now let's take a look at the album, <a href="http://cornmo.bandcamp.com/album/the-magic-is-you">The Magic is You!</a>. Here's where Bandcamp shines. Each album page presents the MUSIC front and center. The player sits below left of the header, the album cover to right. The user wants to press PLAY!</p>

		<p>Unlike with itunes, the PLAY button is huge for each album. Because Bandcamp invites you to stream, whereas iTunes wants to buy, and is loathe to even give a preview taste </p>

	<h3>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives:</h3>

		<p>We're talking about <a href="http://cornmo.bandcamp.com/album/the-magic-is-you">an album player page</a> - and I'd describe it as</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Music player focused.</li>
				<li>Well organized.</li>
				<li>Simple.</li>
				<li>Intuitive.</li>
				<li>Artist-empowering.</li>
			</ol>	
	<h3>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</h3>

		<p>How can musicians present their material in an uncluttered forum, not under the strict beauracracy of a large corporation? Content is mainly music, and arist promotional images.</p>

	<h3>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</h3>

		<p>I'd use the same 5 adjectives. Yeah Bandcamp!</p>

	<h3>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</h3>

		<p>So... here's where we get some critique. Searching is intuitive from <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp's homepage</a>. But I think there is too much clutter on the home page. Some users might be encouraged to start listening to all the material and artists presented on the home page. But I'd prefer a little less artist promotion from the get go. A little more white space please!</p>

		<p>With that said- the search tab is in the header. Also options for artist + fan signup.Navigation is easy. Recommendations are easy, just scroll down.</p>


	<h3>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</h3>

		<p>QUITE.</p>

	<h3>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?</h3>

		<p>Honestly, I feel really excited! So Much MUSIC!! And so many wonderful people making it, and presenting on their own terms in a forum that is relatively easy to monetize on a small scale.</p>

	<h3>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</h3>

		<p>Yes, the site sells music. And here's the major bummer. It's not so much the site, as it is proprietary design by big-brother-Apple.</p>
		<p>Apple prevents any service other than iTunes from downloading music directly to an iPhone. So if you buy music on the site from a mobile device, you need to download it to your host computer, and then sync. I don't know about Androids, but I don't think Bandcamp has a direct sales App, though they do have a streaming App for iphone. Frankly - i think this is really lame, a monopolistic act by Apple. Not cool Steve.</p>


<h2><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a></h2>

	<p>Spotify seems to be the leading music streaming site, that gives The User access to most major label catalogues, and a vast majority of independent professional releases.</p>

	<h3>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</h3>

		<p>Sometimes I want to listen the entirety of Prince's recorded output. And I can by clicking <a href="https://play.spotify.com/search/prince">here</a>.</p>


	<h3>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</h3>

		<p>You have to go through some digital red tape to get to listening - Spotify reeeeeaally wants to know who you are, for all sorts of reasons. But once you get to the <a href="https://play.spotify.com/">play page</a>, design is excellent.</p>

		<p>There is so much material to listen to! And unsurprisingly, for the leader in this field, searching and listening are handled incredibly well. The left sidebar is all devoted to searching tools. The right sidebar is a devoted player. The central content area displays albums, and artist info. It looks reeeeeeallly pretty. I wanna eat it.</p>


	<h3>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives:</h3>
	
		<ol>
			<li>Organized- like a good library.</li>
			<li>Clean, but full. Better use of white space and visual pacing than Bandcamp.</li>
			<li>Simple.</li>
			<li>Intuitive.</li>
			<li>User-empowering.</li>
		</ol>	

	<h3>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</h3>

		<p>How can Spotify present all the music in the world to anyone, at anytime, anywhere? Content is all music, and artist promo images.</p>

	<h3>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</h3>

		<p>I'd use the same 5 adjectives. Yeah Spotify!</p>

	<h3>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</h3>

		<p>This is an incredibly powerful app. Everything seems to be contained in the homepage, because the sidebars that provide the majority of functionality are always there. You never navigate away, even as the center content changes. Lotsa javascript, that I don't yet have aaany clue how it works.</p>


	<h3>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</h3>

		<p>QUITE.</p>

	<h3>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?</h3>

		<p>This is not a site I tend to stare at for a while- it's a site I use to quickly find what I want to listen to. Then I launch the player, and keep the window open in a tab that I ignore for rest of web browsing, or vacuuming, or washing dishes or whatever.</p>

	<h3>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</h3>

		<p>Yes, the site sells subcriptions to the mobile app. And yes, I'm a subscriber. ALSO - as a musician, this is a really contested issue. Spotify's pay-per-stream fee is shit. And there is no way to buy the music through spotify. I am an unknown, as a musician, c'est la vie. Shoulda had more hair. Whatev. BUT - artists who are getting tens of thousands of streams, moderately successful indies, are not making ANY real money off Spotify. And this is not very cool. There needs to be a better model for revenue sharing for streams from Spotify.</p>

<h2><a href="https://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a></h2>

	<p>Soundcloud is perhaps the most popular site for uploading and sharing music + audio. While they seem to appeal strongly to amateur and up-and-coming acts, their success as a social tool has attracted some bigger fish, and now bedroom producers coexist with major releases on the social music site.</p>

	<h3>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</h3>

		<p>The site has grown a lot in the last several months. It's  a powerful tool for makers to share what they've made. Free service, ever growing community of musicians posting projects in all states of development. Demos, live recordings, work in progress... It's cool that process can be broadcast and a part of following an indie artist.</p>


	<h3>What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</h3>

		<p>My eye is first drawn to the player here as well. It's a music sharing site. The distinctive orange of the logo and the player emphasize the player as central to the experience.</p>


	<h3>How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives:</h3>
	
		<ol>
			<li>Spare - much cleaner than the other two.</li>
			<li>Subtle.</li>
			<li>Simple.</li>
			<li>Links allow access to complicated features progressively.</li>
			<li>Organized.</li>
		</ol>	

	<h3>What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</h3>

		<p>How can ANYONE share their audio with world, but not allow the overwhelming amount of content to overwhelm the average user / consumer? Content is music.</p>

	<h3>What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Accessible.</li>
			<li>Social.</li>
			<li>Un-intimidating for anyone to contribute to.</li>
			<li>Un-intimidating for users to navigate.</li>
			<li>Sharing.</li>
		</ol>


	<h3>How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</h3>

		<p>It's easy to navigate recommendations, and curated content. I would love to be able to wade through the mess of EVERYONE without a filter of what the site recommends. Pages link together very well - header stays content and allows access to key features.</p>


	<h3>How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</h3>

		<p>QUITE.</p>

	<h3>How do you feel after being on the site for a while?</h3>

		<p>Curious. I wanna contribute more- and artistically, I want to add instruments to people's tracks and collaborate. I saw a singer-songwriter who solicited musician contributions - that's really cool!</p>

	<h3>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</h3>

		<p>Unclear. Contributors are not empowered to sell their content through the site - though they can of course link externally. Certain artists have direct links to iTunes. I'm not sure what is monetized here, and what potential is here. With that said, I'm most curious about Soundcloud as a place to work. I like the idea of empowering people to make and share music, and even collaborate. I think tools for collaboration could be expanded, and that would be a really exciting project to be involved with.</p>
