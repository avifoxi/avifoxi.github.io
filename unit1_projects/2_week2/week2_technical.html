			<h2>CSS Positioning Methods</h2>
			<p>I've been a bit confused by positioning, so I took this opportunity to delve a little deeper. For full disclosure - the content of this page was taken from <a href="http://learnlayout.com/position.html">learnlayout.com</a>, the most straight forward approach to this I've seen so far. I tried to reproduce the content and positioning from that page within this blog post. So, here we go!</p>

		<div class="static">
		<h2>STATIC POSITIONING</h2>
		<p>static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="relative1">
			<h2>RELATIVE 1</h2>
			<p>relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="relative2">
			<h2>RELATIVE 2</h2>
			<p>Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="relative3">
			<h2>RELATIVE</h2>
			<p>This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.</p>
			<div class="absolute">
				<h2>ABSOLUTE</h2>
				<p>This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent.</p>
			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="fixed">
			<h2>FIXED</h2>
			<p>Hello! Don't pay attention to me yet.</p>
		</div>
