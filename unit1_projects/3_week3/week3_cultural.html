		<h1>A Devil&#39;s Advocate Drinks the Kool-Aid</h1>

		<img id="kool" src="../../images/kool.jpg">


		<p>I love a good restaurant. 
		<br>I also love to cook, and make a mess in the kitchen.</p>

		<p><br>But let&#39;s be real. 
		Shereef is right. DBC is not a restaurant. 
		But neither is DBC an open kitchen. </p>

		<p><br>DBC is an exclusive and expensive culinary academy.
		Which is not to say that I disagree with anything Shereef said in his welcome video.</p> 

		<img id="culinary" src="../../images/culinary.jpg">

		<p><br>I agree that to get the most out of culinary school, you&#39;ve got to do your homework. You&#39;ve got to be ready to produce many collapsed soufflees before you find your signature recipe. You&#39;ve got to WANT TO COOK, and be engaged with your peers as you stumble towards competence. </p>

		<p><br>DBC is providing a service that we as a cohort are consuming. 
		It&#39;s a for profit entity. (It is also clearly invested in our success, and doesn&#39;t take the process lightly.)
		I wouldn&#39;t be here if I didn&#39;t think this was the best place for me to be. I&#39;m ready to roll up my sleeves, admit my immense ignorance, and start slowly building a tool kit. </p>

		<p><br>But <em>We&#39;re All In This Together</em> strikes me as a little shallow when it comes with a $12k price tag. </p>

		<p><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong. 
		I am ready to work VEEEERRRRRYYY hard to become a world class beginner. 
		<br>I expect no free lunch (sic). </p>

		<p><br>And so far I&#39;ve been really impressed with how the information is structured, how we&#39;re being pushed, and the arc of the preparation. </p>

		<p><br>But DBC had better have its ducks in a row when I walk in the door. The instructors better have a really good idea of what the program is, what the curriculum is, and they had better have very strong ideas about their roles as instructors at DBC.  </p>

		<p><br>I don&#39;t expect anybody at DBC to slice me a hunk of knowledge-pie that I eat and suddenly become an employable genius.</p>

		<p><br>But this is clearly an exchange.
		<br>I expect that for amount of money this costs, and the kind of personal investment I am making of time, energy, attention - 
		DBC must devote the resources to crafting a strong and well considered course of study for us all to participate in.</p>

		<p><br>Frankly, so far I&#39;m pretty impressed. The rest of my life is pretty much on hold while I build my tool kit with all of you. </p>

		<p><br>I&#39;m gonna bring my A game, and I hope DBC continues to as well.  </p>
