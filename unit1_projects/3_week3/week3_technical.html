		<h1>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h1>
		<img id="espresso" src="../../images/espresso.jpg">
		
		<p>I googled the above question, and got some delightful responses. Recent-ish articles seem, on the whole, very enthusiastic about JavaScript, with titles such <a href="http://dannorth.net/2011/12/19/the-rise-and-rise-of-javascript/">THE RISE AND RISE OF JAVASCRIPT</a>, <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/08/09/why-javascript-will-become-the-dominant-programming-language-of-the-enterprise#awesm=~oDGI0mfcTzooJq">Why JavaScript Will Become The Dominant Programming Language Of The Enterprise</a>, and <a href="http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/04/will-javascript-take-over-the-programming-world.html">Will JavaScript take over the programming world?</a>. 
		<br>Not bad.</p>

		<p><br>As a newbie dev (full disclosure) I gleaned some very interesting tidbits about JS. It turns out that JS, until the last 5 years or so, was much maligned by experienced devs. Originally developed to add interactivity to web pages, it was engineered to be very lightweight, easy on bandwidth and the browser. This means JS inherently has limited data structures, and syntactically, it&#39;s less sweet than Ruby or Python.</p> 

		<p><br>JS was designed to allow asynchronous rendering of content in the browser. Meaning, JS lets the browser dynamically display content in response to events and user input. Thanks to JS, the page doesn&#39;t display flat and lifeless, but responds to all sorts of input.</p>  

		<p><br>JS is in all browsers - meaning it&#39;s a common language that every computer uses. And its ubiquity has spurned on some really exciting growth in directions likely not anticipated by its creators.</p> 

		<p><br>External libraries, like <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, simplified syntax and readability and added functionality.</p> 

		<p><br>JS has grown to be a server side language as well, via technologies like <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. SO, the same language can function on both the client and the server side, which can speed interactions and data requests. And, it&#39;s also a super fast database laguage, via <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>.</p>

		<p><br>Additionally - several mobile technologies use JS as the system framework. Which allows web developers to leverage their skills, and work as mobile devs without having to learn additional languages. </p>

		<p><br>That&#39;s cool.</p>
		<p><br>I don&#39;t really understand how it all works yet, but jeez. <br>That&#39;s cool.</p>

		<p><br>There seems to be alot of speculation and anticipation in these articles about just how BIG JS can, and should, get. Will it dominate all sectors of development? </p>
		<p>I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m a newb. </p>

		<p><br>BUT - I&#39;m certainly left with the lingering question, WHY ARE WE LEARNING RUBY ON RAILS? If JS is so flexible across platforms, and is super intrinsic to web content, shouldn&#39;t we be focusing there? </p>

		<p><br>Of course, I really have no idea. And thus far, I do feel that Ruby has a much lower threshold for entry for someone like me. I appreciate that. But maybe JS is the more flexible method in the long term. </p>
