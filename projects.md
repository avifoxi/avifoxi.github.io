I love to build things. Often with friends, and often on my own. Here is an ever growing list of projects I've been involved with both as an independent web developer, and as a musician. Enjoy!

## Code Projects

* [Foxi Drum Machine](http://bit.ly/1t3knM8) is an interactive drum sequencer that I built in the browser. Playback is managed by the Web Audio API, and front end is handled by a hand rolled Javascript MVC. Back end is Ruby on Rails. [Github repo](https://github.com/avifoxi/browser-drum-machine)

* [Should I Send This?](http://shouldisendthis.herokuapp.com/) is a Ruby on Rails application that allows you as a writer to compare what you _think_ you're writing against Alchemy API's extraction of your key words and concepts. I proposed this DBC final project, and served as lead for a team of 4 students. [Github repo](https://github.com/avifoxi/should-i-send-this).

* [Prompt and Circumstance](http://promptandcircumstance.herokuapp.com/) is an app for friends to offer responses to each others' prompts. Haikus, jokes, questions, etc. RoR, PostgreSQL. [Github repo](https://github.com/avifoxi/prompt-and-circumstance).

* More soon! Particular interests in client side recording of media, and rendering music notation visually and aurally. Also - multi user synced drum machine. All in the works!

## Music Projects

* [Where Is My Parade?](http://avifoxrosen.bandcamp.com/) is my most recent full length album, released in April 2014. [More info](http://www.avifoxrosen.com/).

* [12 EPs in 2013](http://avifoxrosen.bandcamp.com/album/january-2013) a full year of monthly releases. Read about it [here](http://newyorkmusicdaily.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/bestalbums2013/).

* [.357 Lover](http://357lover.com/) is a wonderful band lead by [Corn Mo](http://cornmo.com/) that I have the privilege of playing with.

* [Yiddish Princess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54fuyQuupDg) yiddish power ballads. It's true.
