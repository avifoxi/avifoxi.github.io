<div class="col-2-3 index-col">
	I am a musician who has made the transition to web development after a 19 week intensive course at Dev Bootcamp. <br>

	<br>I enjoy collaborating with my team through the creative process. Whether I am designing a database backed application, crafting a front end framework for music creation on the web, or arranging a song for performance - I am as committed to the collaborative process as I am to what we produce. <br>

	<br>I strive to create well structured, maintainable code. Code should communicate its intentions, and I enjoy the challenge of making my team’s design intentions explicit in the code we produce. <br>

	<br>I strive to support my teammates, and learn from every member of the team. I communicate respectfully and honestly, and understand that every member of the team contributes to our creative environment.  <br>

	<br>I am curious about how things work, and I take the time to consider structure and convention when solving a problem. I value design, and believe that extra consideration of how we structure our data’s state will pay off in the long run for our applications. <br>
