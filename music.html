<p>I am also a busy musician, with a pretty swell performing and recording life playing rock, jazz, folk, yiddish / jewish, and wierdo musics all over the world. </p>

<p>In 2013, I released an EP of original songs each month, culminating in the full length Where Is My Parade? </p>



<p>My EPs were lauded in <a href="http://newyorkmusicdaily.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/bestalbums2013/">New York Music Daily</a> as among the 50 best recordings of 2013! </p>

<p>I play in many awesome bands and with many awesome people including (but not limited to): .357 Lover, Yiddish Princess, Benjy Fox-Rosen, Basya Schechter and Pharaoh's Daughter, Daniel Kahn, Frank London, Jenny Romaine, Jessica Lurie, Matt Darriau, Sarah Alden, Rima Fand, and many many many more. </p>

<p>I've played venues including Lincoln Center Out of Doors and Damrosch Park, Central Park Summer Stage, Joe's Pub, Symphony Space, Rockwood Music Hall, Krakow Jewish Music Festival Szyroka Square for over 20,000 people... and many local haunts in Brooklyn for less than 10.</p>
