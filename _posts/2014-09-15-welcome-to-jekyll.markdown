It has been a whirlwind 19 weeks as a student at Dev Bootcamp. When I started in April, I had a solid grasp of how to print 'hello world' to the console.

And now - I can confidently design a database backed application from top to bottom, in my choice of frameworks, and track the whole process in Git. WOW. 

So, what now?

I am in the process of putting my best face forward in my search for a job. That means some solid housekeeping on my LinkedIn profile, resume building, building this very blog site, and solidifying my portfolio. I will keep you all appraised of my progress with this blog. 

Thanks for reading!
