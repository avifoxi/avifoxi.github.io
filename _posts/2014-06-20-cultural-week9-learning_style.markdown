According to my Gregorc Thinking Style Test, I most strongly score as a Concrete Random (CR) Learner, followed by my score as a Concrete Sequential (CS) Learner. Read about these general frameworks here. Thank you Mr. Gregorc! 
Also, I love your name. 

This manifests in how I exploit trial + error experimentation, and how I appreciate structure and concrete expectations. I prefer to have the independence to fulfill expectations in my own style. I usually respond really well to structure that I create for myself, while I tend to chafe at structure imposed upon me by others.

I think my biggest challenge in Phase 0 has been adjusting to being a true novice in a new field. I prefer to gain confidence and practice with a new tool before immediately deploying it. And the demands of DBC often mean I have to dive right into something I really don't understand yet. 

For example, when deploying a new tool, I tend to read the instruction manual first off. This is true in implementing new software tools also - I visit the docs, and attempt to get at least a cursory understanding before I put it to work. 
And sometimes, this research phase can take a while - really preventing me from doing the work. My girlfriend might even call it procrastination. I'm on the fence... it may just be a my learning style. OR she may be right. She's usually right. Meh.

DBC (and perhaps software development more generally?) is certainly not the place to bury my head in a book. It's a workshop, and a place to experiment. AND I REALLY LIKE TO EXPERIMENT! But I also like to research, compare approaches, and make an informed choice.

I will need to encourage myelf, rather against my instinct, to jump before I look! 

I think the best way I can to this is by finding pairs who may tend to shoot from the hip a bit more than I, and try to work with them. And let them navigate, and enjoy the roller coaster ride. So many metaphors. Sheesh. 
So much summer. 

Gotta get as much sun as I possibly can before I start DBC! 
WEEKEND AHOY!!!
