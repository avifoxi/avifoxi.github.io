			    <h2>Introductions</h2>
			    
				    <p>Hi fellow bootcampers! I'm <span>Avi Fox-Rosen</span>. There are several things you may notice about me from the get-go. Perhaps I should present them in an orderly fashion, this being the interweb and such.</p>

			<div id="about">  
			    <h2>fox-rosen describes himself thusly:</h2>
			    
				    <ul>
					  <li><em>Musician</em> - indie songwriter, guitarist + multi instrument person, producer.</li>
					  <li><em>Jewish</em> - oh my lordy. So Jewish. In the atheist, anti-authoritarian, smoked fish eating way.</li>
					  <li><em>Bald</em> - it's true. Been true since I was just 15 years old. EEK              !!!</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Why Dev Bootcamp Now Fox-Rosen?</h2>
					<h3>This seems like the appropriate opportunity for an ordered list.</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>I've been working as a freelance musician for 10 years, doing <em>A LOT</em> of music related things to make a living. Many bands, many shows, much teaching, recording, events, etc etc etc.  And it's getting harder to actually make a living doing what I love.</li>
							
							<li>I never would have thought I would become a developer in the past. But I was evaluating where to go and what to do next for employment.<br>Criteria For Evaluating What I Will Do Next:
								<ol type="a">
									<li>creative work</li>
									<li>with creative people</li>
									<li>that will not be downsized in the foreseeable future</li>
								</ol> 
							</li>
							<li>And waddya know? That sounds like dev work. So I been studying, and learning. My girlfriend is an illustrator and developer, and more or less able to balance both. And ideally that's what I want. I have no delusions about being the best, or making a bazillion dollar with my <br> <span>genius startup idea.</span><br> I just want security, in a creative field, that won't view my last 10 years of artsy fartsy ass kicking as a weakness.</li>
