			<h1>Old MacDonald on Classes, Inheritance and Modules</h1>

			<p>Old MacDonald had a farm. But before we sing the song, we need to build it. </p>

			<p><br>Eating and pooping are facts of life. Many differnt life forms that may or may not be on Old MacDonald's farm will need to do these things. So - we will extract eating and pooping from the <em>Animal</em> class, and create an <em>In_n_Out</em> module that we can use and reuse.</p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/1_module.png" alt="module pic">

			<p><br>Now let's make the <em>Animal</em> class. Old MacDonald and his assorted animals will all be members of the Animal class. Each animal has got something to say, stored in the <em>SAY</em> constant hash. Each animal will eat and poop, because we include the <em>In_n_Out</em> module. Each animal has a name, a type, and a belly. We'll be able to view each of those instance variables with our <em>attribute reader</em>function, and each instance of Animal is assigned those variables when initialized.</p>

			<p><br>And that instance method <em>Animal#with_a</em> - wanna guess what it does?</p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/2_animal_class.png" alt="animal class def">
			 
			<p><br>Let's instantiate Old MacDonald, and have him sing a little for us.</p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/3_oldmac_instant.png" alt="old mac instance">

			<p><br>Some of our animals will give milk, so let's make a Milky subclass of Animals. Milky will inherit all of the content from the Animal class, but will contain an additional instance method of <em>Milky#milk</em>. Check it out.</p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/4_milky_class.png" alt="milky make">

			<p><br>Let's instantiate 3 animals, of which 2 are Milky.</p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/5_milkies.png" alt="animals make">

			<p><br>Old MacDonald's ready for a <em>Farm</em>. Farm will be its own class which will designate an instance varible of farmer, and store an array of animals. And we'll instantiate old_mac_farm.</p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/6_farm.png" alt="old_mac_farm">
			 
			<p><br>Wanna milk a cow?</p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/7_cow_milk.png" alt="no milk">

			<p><br>Oops... the animals have to feed first. Here we go!</p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/8_animal_feed.png" alt="animal feed">

			<p>The animals have eaten. Hoorah. Now we'll milk them if they milk. But as for Missy the chicken... she's just gotta do her bizness.</p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/9_milk_poop.png" alt="milk / poop">

			<p><br>Old MacDonald worked so hard for his milk. He deserves to put it in his belly. </p>

			<img class="sub" src="../images/week_6_tech_pics/10_old_drink.png" alt="old mac drink">

			<p><br>All's well on the farm. So let's sing it out loud!</p>
