	<h1>Wireframing: No Longer Just For Kids!</h1>
	<h2><a href="https://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a></h2>

	<p>What problem is the web page solving? What visual challenges are there?</p>

	<p>Souncloud wants users to PLAY the music their content-creators make, but also not be overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of people making stuff. Visual challenges: reduce clutter, while maintaining access to data. Encourage contribution. Encouraging content sharing.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a></h2>

	<p>Spotify wants users to PLAY the music as well - but because the  depth of their data is viewed as an asset (all of recorded music ever, golly gee!) rather than overwhelming, they want to present the vastness of the data in an organized way. So - how do you show users "hey, there's a LOT" while maintaining navigability and accessibility?</p>

	<p>Bandcamp wants to give indie artists a strong platform for streaming and sales. Wants to encourage users to listen, and contribute generally within a donation based pay-what-you will framework. Challenges: Get user to press play. Get them to buy.</p>
